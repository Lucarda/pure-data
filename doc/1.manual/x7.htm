<H3> <A id="advanced-patch-editing">Advanced patch editing</A> </H3>

<P>This section describes advanced techniques and shortcuts for editing patches.

<H3> <A id="tab-navigation">Tab navigation</A> </H3>

<P>When a single box is selected, pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> allows you to
navigate and change the selection to other boxes in the sequence determined
by the order of their creation. Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd> cycles through the
boxes from the earliest created to the next, and upon reaching the last box
in the window the selection loops back to the first one. Conversely, you can
press <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> to navigate in reverse order, moving from the
most recently created box back towards the first created ones.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/tab_navigation_boxes.png" ALT="tab navigation boxes">
</P>

<P>Using <kbd>Tab</kbd> also works in a similar way for patch cords if
you have one selected. You can move from first to last with <kbd>Tab</kbd>
and from last to first with <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd>.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/tab_navigation_cords.png" ALT="tab navigation cords">
</P>

<P>If you're creating a connection by clicking on an outlet and dragging a
patch cord, you can also use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to cycle through outlets.
The navigation order is left to right and it also cycles back. Pressing
<kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> navigates from right to left.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/tab_navigation_iolets.png" ALT="tab navigation iolets">
</P>

<P>In Linux and Windows you can also cycle between inlets. This is currently
not possible on macOS. When dragging a connection into an inlet area, without
releasing the mouse, you can use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to navigate to the next inlet,
or <kbd>Shift + Tab</kbd> to navigate to the previous one.

<H3> <A id="autopatching">Autopatching</A> </H3>

<P>By default, Pd has an 'autopatching' mode set to on. You can disable it
via startup flags (see '-autopatch' flag
<a href="x3.htm#preferences-and-startup-options">Preferences
and startup options</A>). This works with the shortcuts from the <b>Put
menu</b> for inserting boxes. If you have a selected box and use a shortcut
to create another one (such as <kbd>Ctrl + 1</kbd> to create an object box),
the created box is placed below the selected box and a connection is made
from the first outlet of the selected box into the inlet of the newly created
box (granted that these boxes have an outlet and an inlet for the connection
to happen).

<P>Once the new box is created, it is also selected, so you can continue with
autopatching by adding yet more boxes. In the case of object and message boxes
you can also start typing text into it before autopatching into another newly
created box, since when you autopatch for the next one, the object or message
box gets deselected and therefore created.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/autopatch_objects.png" ALT="autopatch objects">
</P>

<P>You can also autopatch into a newly created subpatch (see <A href="x2.htm#subpatches">
Subpatches</A>). By creating an object box and typing [pd], as soon as you
deselect the object, a subpatch is created with an inlet - either a control
inlet ([inlet]) if the object above is a control object, or a signal inlet
([inlet~]) if it is a tilde object instead.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/autopatching_subpatches.png" ALT="autopatching subpatches">
</P>

<H3> <A id="duplicate-connections">Duplicate connections</A> </H3>

<P>If you select a connection between two boxes that have more than one
outlet and inlet for connections, you can use <kbd>Ctrl + D</kbd> to
duplicate and create more connections.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/duplicate_connections.png" ALT="duplicate connections">
</P>

<H3> <A id="managing-connections-with-the-shift-key">Managing connections
with the Shift key</A> </H3>

<P>You can swap connections if you selected a connection and use
<kbd>Shift + Click</kbd> on another one.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/swap_connections.png" ALT="swap connections">
</P>

<P>You can "fan out" connections when no boxes are selected. You can
start creating a connection by clicking an outlet and dragging a cord
and then use <kbd>Shift</kbd> when you reach the inlet destination
(without releasing the mouse button). This "fans out" out and creates
another connection from the outlet for you to drag somewhere else and
connect the same outlet to to multiple inlets sequentially.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/drag_fan_out.png" ALT="drag fan out">
</P>

<P>Also for fanning out, if you have a group of target boxes that are selected,
you can drag a cord from an outlet of an unselected box and press <kbd>Shift</kbd>
to create a connection into the same inlet number of the selected boxes (which do
not need to be of the same type or class).

<P>
    <IMG src="img/select_fan_out.png" ALT="select fan out">
</P>

<P>You can create a connection from the same outlet number of multiple boxes to
a single inlet. If you have a selection of source boxes, you can drag a cord from
one of their outlets into another box and press <kbd>Shift</kbd> to create multiple
connections from the same outlet number of the selected boxes (which do not need to
be of the same type or class).

<P>
    <IMG src="img/select_fan_in.png" ALT="select fan in">
</P>

<P>You can connect multiple outlets and inlets of 2 boxes if you have 2 selected
boxes. Start creating a connection and click <kbd>Shift</kbd> at completion.
This creates all possible connections starting from the chosen outlet and inlet.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/multiple_connections.png" ALT="multiple connections">
</P>

<P>You can connect outlets of multiple boxes into multiple inlets of one box.
If there's a selected group of boxes, you start creating a connection into an
inlet of a box that is part of the selection. Then you can press <kbd>Shift</kbd>
so connections are made from the same outlet number of all source boxes (which do
not need to be of the same type or class) into separate inlets, starting from the
chosen inlet.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/many_to_one.png" ALT="many to one">
</P>

<P>You can spread multiple outlets of one box into same inlets of other boxes.
Similarly to the scenario above, you can start dragging from one outlet of a
selected box with multiple outlets to an inlet of one of many selected boxes.
In this case, when you press <kbd>Shift</kbd>, all possible connections are
made from the outlets of the source box to the same inlet numbers of the target
boxes.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/one_to_many.png" ALT=" one to many">
</P>


<H3> <A id="disconnect-selection">(Dis)Connect selection</A> </H3>

<P>This is a menu entry in the <b>Edit menu</b>, also available via the shortcut
<kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd>. It allows you to connect and disconnect selected boxes in
different ways.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/ctrl_k.png" ALT="ctrl+k">
</P>

<P>For 2 selected boxes you can use <kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd> to connect
them. Repeat using <kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd> to make multiple connections
from possible remaining outlets to inlets.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/repeat_ctrl_k.png" ALT="repeat ctrl+k">
</P>

<P>For 2 selected tilde objects, if the origin object has a single outlet and
the target object has many inlets, you can repeatedly use <kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd>
to fan out and connect the same outlet to all inlets.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/fan_out_audio.png" ALT="fan out audio">
</P>

<P>For last, you can include or bypass a box into or from a connection
(being it any connection from any outlet into any inlet). To include a box,
you can select it and the connection between the other 2 boxes by using
<kbd>Shift + Click</kbd> and then use <kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd> to include
the selected box into the connection. Alternatively, you can select the 3
boxes with a connection between 2 of them and then use <kbd>Shift + Click</kbd>
to include the third one in the connection.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/insert_box.png" ALT="insert box">
</P>

<P>To bypass a box, you can select 3 boxes connected in a row and use
<kbd>Ctrl + K</kbd> to bypass and remove the middle box from the connection.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/exclude_box.png" ALT="exclude box">
</P>

<H3> <A id="triggerize">Triggerize</A> </H3>

<P>The 'Triggerize' entry in the <b>Edit menu</b> with the <kbd>Ctrl + T</kbd>
shortcut was designed to insert a [trigger] object (in its abbreviated form [t]).
When you select a single box that is connected to many inlets of a single or
multiple boxes use "Triggerize" to insert this object, which is briefly described
in <A href="x2.htm#hot-and-cold-inlets-and-right-to-left-outlet-order">
Hot and cold inlets and right to left outlet order</A>.

<P>The [trigger] object is widely used in Pd to control the order of execution
from right to left. 'Triggerize' then creates the [trigger] object taking into
account the order in which the connections were made, where the first connection
starts at the rightmost outlet of [trigger] and continues to the leftmost.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/triggerize_object.png" ALT="triggerize object">
</P>

<P>Additionally, the 'Triggerize' option can be used to insert a dummy object.
To do so, select a connection and use <kbd>Ctrl + T</kbd>. For a control
connection, a [t a] object is created with the text selected, so you
can type another text to include another object instead. For a signal
connection, a [pd nop~] subpatch is created, also with the text selected
for you to replace for a new object.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/insert_dummy.png" ALT="insert dummy">
</P>

<P>While the connections of a [trigger] object can be resorted as
<A href="x7.htm#managing-connections-with-the-shift-key">explained
above</A>, <kbd>Ctrl + T</kbd> also allows you to easily manage its
outlets when using it on the selected object. The result will differ
depending on the existing connections and outlets. If each outlet
has a single connection, it will insert an outlet on the left.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/add_1st_outlet.png" ALT="add 1st outlet">
</P>

If the [trigger] object has more outlets than outgoing connections, the
shortcut will reduce the outlets, removing the unused ones.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/reduce_outlets.png" ALT="reduce outlets">
</P>

In case there are more connections than outlets, it will add outlets to
distribute all connections to separate ones (following the creation order
of the connections from right to left). This way, you can add connections
inbetween other connections without lots of resorting.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/distribute_connections.png" ALT="distribute connections">
</P>

<P>
<H3> <A id="paste-replace">Paste replace</A> </H3>

<P>The 'Paste Replace' entry in the <b>Edit menu</b> doesn't have a
shortcut and performs a special paste operation where it replaces a selection
of boxes for another kind. For example, first copy one box such as a
[float] object. Then select a group of boxes of the same type, for
instance, a group of object boxes (note that they don't need to be
of the same class). Now go to the <b>Edit menu</b> and select "Paste Replace".
All the selected boxes of the same type get replaced by the copied box
and connections are preserved.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/paste_replace_entry.png" ALT="paste replace entry">
</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can copy a number box instead of a [float] object
and replace it in the selected group of objects, or in a selected group
of another kind, such as message boxes. Note that the box types in Pd
are: objects, messages, GUIs and comments, whereas 'IEMguis' are actually
treated in this case as regular object boxes. Hence, the GUI boxes are
only the number box, the symbol box and the list box. Also note that
these three GUIs are not of the same kind for the purpose of "Paste Replace".
A subpatch or an abstraction can also be used for "Paste Replace" and they
count in the same group of objects.

<P>
    <IMG src="img/paste_replace_boxes.png" ALT="paste replace boxes">
</P>

<P>If you have a selection of boxes to replace that includes different
types of boxes, the "Paste Replace" will only replace the boxes of the
same type that was copied.
